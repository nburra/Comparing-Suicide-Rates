WHO country data suicide rate data was imported into Spyder. This data is read and parsed into a table with rows. The specified countries of the US and Afghanistan were chosen through the select_country function; this also read and selected the rate and sex data for each country. These data points were then displayed through Matplotlib and visualized through a multi-faceted graph. The graph compares the suicide rates of Afghanistan (a developing country) and the United States (a developed country). This data is crucial because it highlights significant differences in suicide rates between these two countries. Specifically, the trend for both sexes in the United States shows a clear decrease from 2000 to 2015, whereas Afghanistan exhibits an increase. This disparity may be due to differences in healthcare systems. Afghanistan's healthcare system is less developed and lacks resources for mental health care, while the United States has a more advanced healthcare infrastructure with greater access to mental health services. Additionally, the comparison between male and female suicide rates reveals that, in the United States, both genders show a decreasing trend, aligning with the overall decline in suicide rates for both sexes. Conversely, Afghanistan shows a notable increase in the male suicide rate, while the female rate remains relatively stable with a minor decrease."
